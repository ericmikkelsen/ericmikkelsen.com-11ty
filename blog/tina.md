I'd like to talk to you about Tina. She's my best friend's mom. She is made out of giving and joy, and she's a blast. I haven't hung out enough with Tina, but I've known her for over 35 years. She's been there for her family every damn second they've needed her, for as long as I can remember. To the point where I'm dumbfounded by how much she could take on.

## [You should give Tina money](https://www.gofundme.com/f/tina-juhlin-handstand-fund)

Tina has cancer. I don't know what else to tell you, she's an amazing person, mom, grandmom, and gymnist (yep grandma gymnist), and she has cancer. [So give her money](https://www.gofundme.com/f/tina-juhlin-handstand-fund), that's her gofundme page. So please help out.
