## Defining line height

Line-height is extra space above and below your text. It creates extra space between lines of text. It's the web's version of leading.

Here are some examples of different line-heights.

The text above has alot more space between lines. While the text below has much less space between lines. More line-height means more space as you can see in these 2 examples.

## What is a good line height?

In her Smashing Magazine article: [Balancing Line Length And Font Size In Responsive Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/balancing-line-length-font-size-responsive-web-design/#line-height-and-font-size), Laura Franz says: 
> "Smaller type tends to need more line height, not less. A generous line height helps the eye to recognize small word shapes more easily, and it encourages horizontal motion when the eye gets tired of reading small text."

The WCAG (aka Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) say: 
> "[ ... paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/visual-presentation.html#:~:text=Line%20spacing%20(leading)%20is%20at%20least%20space-and-a-half%20within%20paragraphs%2C%20and%20paragraph%20spacing%20is%20at%20least%201.5%20times%20larger%20than%20the%20line%20spacing.)"

### I think good line height is ...

So a good line-height for body copy is at least 150% of the font size, with more line height for smaller text, and less line height for larger text.

## Finding a universal line height

As a developer who works with designers, I try to find a way to make it easy to repeat the usability and beauty of what my designers dreamed up. I try to come up with rules, based on their designs.

If we look at the extra space in our line height on our body copy, I think that's probably a good guide for how much extra space all the line heights on everything should be. 

### Forgive my math

If our font size on body copy is 16px and our line height is 24px(150% of the font-size), that's 8px of extra space.
