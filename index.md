 I'm a web developer. If you're in the tech world, that means I love CSS, write Javscript, can do React/Vue/Svelte, worry about accessbility, obsess over performance, program in HTML, and started on Wordpress.

 If you're my Aunt Sophie (HI SOPHIE!), that means I make websites.

## Where I'm at.

I work at a [Boldium](https://boldium.com), where I work with a great team of people solving problems and building websites for clients, while still caring about the planet and people.

## I kill time making art(ish)

I love glitching, screen printing, generative-ing, risographing, and pixelating.
