I've been alot of stuff, I started as the guy who said "Um boss, CSS can do that", and I've graduated to being the guy who says "this is how I can make this work for screen readers and keyboard users, can you make this one small tweek to the design?".

## Where I'm at.

I work at [Boldium](https://boldium.com), where I work with a great team of people solving problems and building websites for clients, while still caring about the planet and people.

## I kill time making art(ish)

I spend as much time as possible playing with my kid. When I have weird sideways time, I make pizza, roast coffee, and go for bike rides.
