I make better websites, by making websites for people. People who are blind. People who are in the middle of nowhere holding their phones over their head trying to "catch" a signal. People who are sitting on a toilet in a concrete building. People who are deaf. People with phones that cost a hundred bucks (or less). People who are holding a bag of groceries in their good hand, and are using their phone with the accuracy of a 2 year old in the other hand. People who have motor function problems. People like you.

## Where I'm at

I work at a [Boldium](https://boldium.com), where I work with a great team of people solving problems and building websites for clients, while still caring about the planet and people.

<!-- ## I frick'n love every single designer I ever worked with.

Jason, Sarah, Buddy, Tai, Amber, George, Nick, Laura, Rusty, Rochelle, Gosia, Ariel, and Matt. Every single one is brilliant, and if you're a designer, I bet you are too. I wanna be friends. -->

## I kill time making art(ish)

I love glitching, screen printing, generative-ing, risographing, and pixelating.
