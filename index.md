That sounds like some hooey though, what do I mean? I mean when collaborating with a team, I talk about how people use websites. Like people using screen readers, or keyboards, or touch screens, or low to medium speed internet connections, or library computers.

## I also kill time making art

I love glitching, screen printing, generative-ing, risographing, and pixelating.
